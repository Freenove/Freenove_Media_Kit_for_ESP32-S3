    :align: center

**The first compilation may take longerâ€”please ensure a stable internet connection and wait patiently.**

If you encounter the following error during compilation, it's typically caused by issues with the ESP-IDF toolchain. This often occurs due to network problems that prevented some toolchain components from installing properly. Please reinstall ESP-IDF. You can refer to :ref:`ESP-IDF V5.4.1 <fnk0102/codes/openai/openai_code:esp-idf v5.4.1>`.
