AI Voice Assistant Based on OpenAI Realtime model
##############################################################################

This project applies the Media Kit to develop an AI voice assistant for conversations with OpenAI. It requires basic programming skills and some familiarity with OpenAI.

About the Project
*******************************

This voice assistant project (https://github.com/Freenove/openai-realtime-embedded) is based on OpenAI's open-source project openai-realtime-embedded (https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-embedded). It enables embedded devices to call OpenAI's Realtime Model APIs, such as GPT-4o Realtime and GPT-4o Mini Realtime, allowing you to build your own AI voice assistant.

Freenove has adapted this project for its Media Kit product. This article will guide you on how to run it on the Media Kit.

About OpenAI
*******************************

OpenAI is a leading artificial intelligence research and deployment company committed to ensuring that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. Guided by principles of openness, collaboration, and safety, the organization drives the development and practical application of cutting-edge models. These include the renowned GPT series of language models, the DALLÂ·E image generation model, as well as speech recognition and synthesis tools like Whisper.

OpenAI not only provides powerful AI models but also offers API services that enable developers to easily integrate these models into their own products. Recently, OpenAI launched its new Realtime API, which significantly enhances conversational naturalness through direct streaming of audio input and output, with automatic interruption handling capabilities.

However, it's important to note that:

- 1.	OpenAI currently does not offer free services

- 2.	The Realtime API currently only supports: 

GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models

The latest transcription models: GPT-4o Transcribe and GPT-4o mini Transcribe

Please see the following flowchart. 

  - The ESP32-S3 executes the openai-realtime-embedded source code, establishes a WiFi connection, and streams audio data to OpenAI's servers.

  - Upon receiving the audio stream, OpenAI's servers process the data, generate text responses, and synthesize corresponding audio, which is then transmitted back to the ESP32-S3 via WiFi.

  - In this project, the ESP32-S3 communicates with OpenAI's servers using the WebSocket protocol.

Install CH343 Driver (Required)
********************************************

ESP32-S3 WROOM uses CH343 to download codes. So before using it, we need to install CH343 driver in our computers.

Windows
===========================================

1.	First, download CH343 driver, click https://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH343.html? to download the appropriate one based on your operating system.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Openai/AI_Voice_Assistant_Based_on_OpenAI_Realtime_model/Chapter01_03.png

Linux
=========================================

Here we take Ubuntu as an example. Open the terminal in Linux system.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Openai/AI_Voice_Assistant_Based_on_OpenAI_Realtime_model/Chapter01_18.png
    :align: center

Check the port with the command "lsusb".

.. code-block:: console
    
    lsusb
    ls /dev/tty*

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Openai/AI_Voice_Assistant_Based_on_OpenAI_Realtime_model/Chapter01_19.png
    :align: center

Generally, the CH34x driver is included in modern Linux kernels, so it should work automatically when the device is connected

If your computer does not have the CH343 driver, you can follow the steps below to install it. If your computer recognizes the CH343 driver, you may skip the following steps.

Run the following command to download the driver.

.. code-block:: console
    
    git clone https://github.com/WCHSoftGroup/ch343ser_linux.git

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Openai/AI_Voice_Assistant_Based_on_OpenAI_Realtime_model/Chapter01_20.png
    :align: center

Enter the folder where the driver locates.

.. code-block:: console
    
    cd ch343ser_linux/driver/

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Openai/AI_Voice_Assistant_Based_on_OpenAI_Realtime_model/Chapter01_21.png
    :align: center

Compile to generate a ch343.ko file.

.. code-block:: console
    
    make

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Openai/AI_Voice_Assistant_Based_on_OpenAI_Realtime_model/Chapter01_22.png
    :align: center

Install the ch343 chip driver.

.. code-block:: console
    
    sudo make load
    sudo make install

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Openai/AI_Voice_Assistant_Based_on_OpenAI_Realtime_model/Chapter01_23.png
    :align: center

Connect the ESP32S3 to your computer, run the following command and you should see the port.

.. code-block:: console
    
    ls /dev/tty*

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Openai/AI_Voice_Assistant_Based_on_OpenAI_Realtime_model/Chapter01_24.png
    :align: center

In Linux, higher permissions are required to access "ttyACM0," so privilege escalation commands must be used.

.. code-block:: console
    
    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
    sudo reboot

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Openai/AI_Voice_Assistant_Based_on_OpenAI_Realtime_model/Chapter01_25.png
    :align: center

Reboot the system to have the configuration take effect.
